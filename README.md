# PesaTally

PesaTally is a visually engaging and intuitive Android savings tracker app built with Java. The app allows users to track their savings goals using jars as visual representations. Each jar represents a savings goal, with progress shown as liquid filling the jar, complete with a wavy animation.

## Features

- **Visual Goal Representation**: Savings goals are represented as jars.
- **Dynamic Liquid Animation**: Progress is displayed as liquid with smooth, wavy animations.
- **Color-Coded Progress**: Different colors represent progress levels:
    - Blue: Less than 30% saved.
    - Yellow: 30% to 70% saved.
    - Green: Over 70% saved.
- **Customizable Goals**: Add and manage multiple savings goals.
